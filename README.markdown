# Shoutinside #

## Overview ##

This project implements a simply networking pricple to transfer the text between the people working with in a lan.
The message is then sent to all the clients currently active in the communication process. This program can also save the conversation
and it can even transfer the files between the listed and active clients.

It has two parts

## Documentation ##

You can find the documentation in the `doc` folder coming with this project. I have added the build html folder to 
the repository, so you don't need to build it by yourself.
